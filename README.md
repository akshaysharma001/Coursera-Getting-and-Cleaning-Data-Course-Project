# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project


Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
